Header Files:
The code includes standard C libraries for input/output (stdio.h), threading (pthread.h), semaphores (semaphore.h), and unistd.h for the sleep function.

Macro Definition:
MAX_PASSENGERS is defined as 1000, representing the maximum number of passengers.

Global Variables:
Various global variables are declared to track information about passengers, the car, and synchronization between threads.

Semaphores:
Four semaphores (semaphore_mutex, boardingQueue, rideInProgress, unboardingQueue) are declared for synchronization between the car and passengers.

Car Thread (car function):
An infinite loop simulates the car's behavior: loading passengers, signaling them to board, waiting for them to board, simulating a ride, unloading passengers, signaling them to unboard, and waiting for them to unboard.

Passenger Thread (passenger function):
An infinite loop simulates the passenger's behavior: waiting for the car to be ready, boarding the car, signaling that it has boarded, waiting for the ride to finish, unboarding, and signaling that it has unboarded.

Loading and Unloading Functions:
load and unload functions simulate the loading and unloading processes of the car, respectively.

Boarding and Unboarding Functions:
board and offboard functions simulate a passenger boarding and unboarding the car, respectively.

Total Passenger Functions:
totalPassenger function prints the total number of passengers that have traveled.

Main Function:
User inputs the total number of passengers and car capacity.
If the car's capacity is greater than or equal to the total passengers, an error message is displayed, and the program exits.
Semaphores are initialized.
The car thread is created, and a success message is printed.
Passenger threads are created, each with a unique ID.
Threads are joined to the main thread for synchronization.
Semaphores are destroyed before the program exits.

Explanation of Print Statements:
Various printf statements are used to display messages indicating loading, unloading, boarding, and unboarding actions, as well as the progress of the ride.
Sleep Function:
sleep is used to simulate time passing during loading, unloading, and the ride.

Error Check for Capacity and Passengers:
The program checks if the car's capacity is greater than or equal to the total number of passengers and exits with an error message if true.
